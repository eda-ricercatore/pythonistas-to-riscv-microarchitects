	- uses hdl/conda-eda to install open-source EDA tools
		* https://github.com/hdl/conda-eda/tree/master/.github/workflows
	- use OpenLane from The OpenROAD Project
		* https://openlane.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/configuration.html
		* https://theopenroadproject.org/
	- also has information about using Verilog design with multiple Verilog modules
	- has useful information about Tcl scripts for VLSI CAD
		* Also uses Python code to configure Tcl script(s) for VLSI CAD
		* has errors that need to be fixed
	- has Python code to display IC layout design
		* has errors that need to be fixed
	- has Python code to show report about the IC layout/design
+ https://github.com/sscs-ose/sscs-ose-code-a-chip.github.io/blob/main/ISSCC23/accepted_notebooks/scan_register_gen_colab.ipynb
	- https://colab.research.google.com/github/sscs-ose/sscs-ose-code-a-chip.github.io/blob/main/ISSCC23/accepted_notebooks/scan_register_gen_colab.ipynb
	- use condacolab to interface between the Conda/Anaconda environment of the Jupyter notebook, and software applications that I need to use
	- use YAML file to configure the MAMBA set-up
		* learn to write yaml files
	- use Mamba with aforementioned YAML file (as an input file) to install software
	- uses a long process to generate the physical design
	- ***Has error with version mismatch of CPython ***
		* with top-level layout design
		* with PySPICE circuit simulation
	- can do LVS
